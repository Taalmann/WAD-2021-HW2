I hope that I have finished with points 1, 2, 3, 6. If something isn't ok, pls let me know.
I added also some text files with explanations (for any case).
I don't know, do we need to store our photos for point 4 on internet or we can use our local directory for that.
For any case, I put them also on my Google Drive and provided links in photos_links.txt
