For our JSON file validating I used https://jsonlint.com/ and got the answer "Valid JSON".
To experiment with different tools, I also validated our JSON file on
  1) https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/#
     and got the answer "VALID (RFC 8259)".This validator is not displaying JSON file's line numbers. We can here
     format our JSON file, also.
  2) https://codebeautify.org/jsonvalidator and had also the answer "Valid JSON". https://codebeautify.org can be used
     also as JSON beautifier. And it has a useful JSON code Tree Viewer.
  3) https://beautifytools.com and got the same answer. This tool has JSON beautifier option,also.
