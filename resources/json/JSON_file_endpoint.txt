"An "exposed JSON endpoint" is a publicly available URL (sometimes with query or path parameters added by you)
which you can send an HTTP request to and it will return JSON from the remote server that is related to the request
you sent."  (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33005405/how-to-consume-a-json-endpoint Oct 8, 2015)

"Simply put, an endpoint is one end of a communication channel. When an API interacts with another system, the
touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints. For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a server or
service. Each endpoint is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function.

APIs work using ‘requests’ and ‘responses.’ When an API requests information from a web application or web server,
it will receive a response. The place that APIs send requests and where the resource lives, is called an endpoint."
